This folder is 11th in the series and comes after 10-wrapper. It is created to explain inheritance and different access levels of members of parents class. here we have two different packages (or families):

1. white
2. black

only white has a parent, and this parent has one child in white family and one child in black family. the cousin in both of the families is not child of the parent class.
we have imported different classes when it is important to show what happens when you indirectly try to access members of classes.
